          <h3>Spartan Code - MVC with a twist.</h3>

<p>Spartan code is a nice name for an approach to MVC-Pull in the land of web development frameworks. It is meant to ease development by keeping the programmer focused and the planning by keeping things separate. Altogether awesome results ahead!</p>

<p>The Spartan Code process is easy:</p>

<pre><code>1. Make mockup
2. Code the program 
</code></pre>

<h3>Spartan for PHP</h3>

<p>The first implementation for Spartan Code is in PHP. Its an app starter that gives you awesome templating, easy query management, URI routing and some helpers. There are no libraries included but you can use basically anything that you fancy!</p>

<h3>Spartan Templating for Wordpress</h3>

<p>This is a port of the PHP framework as a WP plugin. After it is installed it allows you to create WP themes that use the awesome spartan templating for both WP functionality and your own custom things. It also gives you the choice to encapsulate in models your WP theme specific work!</p>

<h3>Spartan Templating for Code Igniter</h3>

<p>The CI port is a helper file that allows skipping controllers and using the models as the sole source of data and logic. As always with spartan you'll need only one controller. The Views will parse Spartan comments and pull their data from the models directly.</p>
